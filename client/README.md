#Client instructions

##Before starting this, make sure to follow the README in the root directory for server set-up

- Enter the client directory from the root directory

```
cd client
```

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

###In another terminal window, make sure the server is running, you can follow instructions for that in the README in the parent directory

- Once the server is running and dependencies are installed

```
npm run start

```

This will start a process at http://localhost:3000/ and from there can view the client for Tinycakes!
